## About the Project

Brief description of the project: what it is, why it was created, and its main purpose.

### Sequence of Operation

This section explains what to expect once all hardware and software has been set up according to **Getting Started**. It is intended as a guide for non-technical users.

1. Connect the board to your computer via USB.
2. The green LED will automatically turn on to indicate the system is active.
3. A welcome message will appear in the serial terminal.
4. The linear slider performs an automatic calibration and moves to the center.
5. Wait for a beep signal and then place the phone on the slider holder.

Follow any additional instructions shown in the terminal or on the interface.



## Materials and Methods

> ðŸ’¡**Version-Control-Friendly Practices**
>
> Use **plain text formats** like Markdown or CSV files. These are readable on GitHub and well-suited for version control.
>
> Avoid linking to external files (e.g. datasheets or images). Instead, store them locally in a `media` or `datasheets` folder. External links can break when the source changes or if this repository is renamed, forked, or cloned.
